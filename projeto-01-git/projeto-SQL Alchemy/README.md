# Introduction

This README file objective is to show how to use the main program to insert repositories from GitHub, on a DataBase, just by typing your desired Git username. Based on Requests and SQL Alchemy libraries, this is a simple code to train skills on Python.

# Requirements
* Python installed
* Basic skills on Python
* Json
* Requests Library installed 
* Integrated development environment (IDE)
* SQL Alchemy

## Installation

For Python installation, just use the Python [site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the steps. (Don't forget to add Python to PATH)

For the libraries used on the program, use [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to download all of them:

```
    > pip install -r install.txt
```


# Download and Execution

Download then run the code on your IDE till you have this response: 
``` 
    Enter a username to search:
```

Then you type the username that you want. With this done, you should get a list of repositories that are being add on your DB based on what username you've typed.
